## Privacy-related-sites
- [PrivacyGuides](https://privacyguides.org): **Onion supported too!**. A webpage of reference for learning, or asking about any privacy topic. They have guides on tooling recommendations as well as a really nice forum. **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**.
- [Monerica](https://monerica.com/): A webpage which aims to create a circular economy arround the usage of Monero. You can find businesses, education, finance, wallets, web-hosting services, freelancers etc..
- [Coincards](https://coincards.com/): A webpage that allows to purchase lots of different gift cards for major websites with major Cyrptocurrencies without any KYC requirement nor similar. (Sadly, no ZCash is accepted. So unless using Monero, be careful on linking your ETH or BTC account for example!)
