# privacy-tools
A collection of interesting and useful privacy tools I've found during my life and thought are worth using/looking at.

Use at your own risk.

I don't get anything for listing this. This is personal taste only and opinionated on what I like, and how well things go with my style and needs.

## Privacy-related-sites
- [PrivacyGuides](https://privacyguides.org): **Onion supported too!**. A webpage of reference for learning, or asking about any privacy topic. They have guides on tooling recommendations as well as a really nice forum. **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**.
- [Monerica](https://monerica.com/): A webpage which aims to create a circular economy arround the usage of Monero. You can find businesses, education, finance, wallets, web-hosting services, freelancers etc..
- [Coincards](https://coincards.com/): A webpage that allows to purchase lots of different gift cards for major websites with major Cyrptocurrencies without any KYC requirement nor similar. (Sadly, no ZCash is accepted. So unless using Monero, be careful on linking your ETH or BTC account for example!)

## Browsers

## Password-managers
- [pass](https://github.com/mihaigalos/pass): A really nice git-based password manager based on Yubikey as source of encryption (backed by [rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage)).
- [ProtonPass](https://proton.me/pass): An incredibly good password manager really nicely integrated with the rest of Proton's suite.
It natively supports:
- Logins
- Email aliases with SimpleLogin (only with ProtonUnlimited).
- Notes
- Identities
- Cards
It also includes vault-sepparation for different profiles (a la Firefox). As well as support and sync between devices, a really good UI/UX, double password and encryption for all of the contents E2E.

## Backup-tools
- [Kopia](https://kopia.io/): A fast, incremental, encrypted and compressed backup-creator/manager tool completelly FOSS. Integrates with all the major Cloud Storage providers. 
Also can work with network-connected machines, local storage etc...
